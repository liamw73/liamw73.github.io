This project can perform tasks like inventory management, budget allocation, and administrative tasks all in one secure program. It is secured with limited-permission user log in as well as manager log in with admin access. Usernames and passwords are stored in a database along with user written and historical data. This proprietary program was built from the ground up in Visual Basic and utilizes macros to seamlessly update in real time based off user input.
