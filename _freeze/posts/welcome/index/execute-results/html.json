Multiple python programs are chained together to generate visualizations along with regression, logical, and statistical significance tests that clarify the telecom market, monthly trends, and correlation between factors that affect the bottom line. This data was used to formulate a final proposal, broken down into monthly phases, that promises to not only reduce customer churn, but also increase customer retention. This project is tailored to C-suite level executives and lays out a path to market domination.\n\n::: {#0510b591 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nCustomer churn, or the rate in which customers halt service, is a large issue for subscription-based companies. Minimizing the rate of churn retains revenue and puts less priority on expensive customer acquisition strategies. This analysis will focus on the telecom industry, a sector that has evolved from a luxury to a necessity in our modern, connected way of living.\n\nChurn rates in the telecom sector sat at an average 21% across the industry in 2020, increasing to 31% in the following year, <https://customergauge.com/blog/average-churn-rate-by-industry> (Customer Gauge, 2024).\n\nThis trend of escalating customer churn poses a risk to the revenue of telecom organizations. Recent changes in the market like fiber optic construction, more robust customer service options, and optimization of infrastructure have placed more buying power in the hands of the consumer who is looking for reliable internet at a reasonable price.\n\nThis report uses two datasets encompassing churn within the telecom industry during the second and third quarters of 2022. These datasets track various metrics like tenure, monthly cost, reason for churn, churn status, and many more to provide an accurate simulation to determine the most valuable trends between churned and active customers and formulate actionable solutions to minimize churn. When combined and cleaned, this dataset contains 7,042 rows of real-world customer data.\n\nFinally, this project yields an actionable plan to reducing customer churn. A 3-month plan was formulated, aimed to capture new and potential customers and retain loyal subscribers, implementing overhauls to onboarding processes, discounts, customer service, and data collection.\n\n# Purpose\n\nThis report is ultimately tailored for C-suite level executives within a given telecom company, however this report is also relevant to analysts or marketing firms tasked with minimizing customer churn.\n\nThere are a few insights to keep in mind while reading this report. Due to limitations within the available data, real world effects resulting from provided solutions will not be measurable until implementation. Customer churn is inevitable, however the goal is to see a noticeable decrease after implementing the solutions. Due to the limited scope in regards to time, this report is only showing trends in the second and third quarters, annual time trends will not be fully visible. Being aware of these trends allows the audience to implement the recommendations, measure the results, compare them to industry average (31%), and apply/compare them to a more macro centered dataset with a wider time scope.\n\nThe data and analyses found within this report will first identify and weigh the leading variables surrounding customer churn. These variables were used to formulate tangible actions that, when implemented, work to minimize customer churn, in turn stabilizing monthly cash flow and maximizing revenue.\n\n# Situation\n\nBelow is a combination of two datasets encompassing multiple telecom companies across the U.S, this dataset contains 7,042 rows, each row representing an active household. This dataset contains 13 columns, 12 serving as a factor influencing customer churn, and one serving as a binary, describing whether the customer churned or is still active. The datasets were cleaned to omit irrelevant columns or rows, and combine similar columns. The new dataset dropped roughly 48% of the original data found within the two datasets. Reputing, or the filling of missing data with 'dummy data', was avoided to retain accuracy.\n\n::: {#981ead6e .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntelecom_customer_churn_df =

The average age for the customers within the dataset was 46.5 with a monthly rate of \\$63.60 and a tenure of 32 months. This paints a fairly vivid picture of the most common customer found within this data.\n\nNow that the data is ready to be visualized, I can formulate a few hypotheses about which variables are going to correlate with churn. - Churn will vary by internet type, this is limited to traditional (DSL), fiber optic, and none. I surmise that fiber will carry a higher churn rate, given its acceleration in infrastructure opening the market for competitors. - Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn, I believe the churn count will cluster about one standard deviation above the mean (mean: 63 + st. dev: 31). - Newer customers will be more likely to churn.\n\n# Churn Rates by Internet Service Type\n\nDSL(traditional coaxial internet) has a much lower churn rate than Fiber Optic, perhaps this is due to the widespread emergence of Fiber Optics capabilities across competitiors. Customers without internet seem to be the most loyal, perhaps due to lower monthly charges. Priority should lean toward retaining fiber customers, and increasing infrastructure to allow that priority.\n\n::: {#55c9dc67 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Figure 1.

This is caused by the more widespread emergence of infrastructure in the fiber optic landscape, allowing competitors the opportunity to price them out. Another reason for the trend is fiber's allure of fast and reliable internet speeds. An opportunity was revealed when looking at the churn rate across monthly price points. Churned customers clustered around the mid-to-high price point, this is directly caused by being priced out by competition. By focusing on competitive pricing, speeds, and reliability, customers will be less likely to churn and provide more stable monthly cash flow. However these are fairly boilerplate strategies for a business looking to maximize revenue, more tests can be ran to determine more nuanced methods of churn minimization.\n\n# T-test, Monthly Charges and Tenure in Regards to Churned and Stayed Customers\n\n### Monthly charges:\n\n-   A positive t-statistic indicates that, on average, churned customers experienced higher monthly charges than customer who stayed.\n-   With a p-value less than 0.05, we can safely reject the null hypothesis, this is a hypothesis that surmises that there is no significant relationship between variables. In this instance, the p-value of 6.1e-57 is far below the significance threshold of 0.05. This indicates that there is a statistically significant difference in the average monthly charges between churned and retained customers, supporting the previous hypotheses made about monthly payments.\n\n### Tenure:\n\n-   A large negative t-statistic indicates that churned customers have significantly shorter tenures than retained customers. This implies that churned customers leave much earlier in their subscription lifecycle compared to retained customers.\n-   With an even smaller p-value than the previous test, we can confidently reject the null hypothesis. Shorter tenures are strongly associated with churn.\n\n::: {#9b558bb9 .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nchurned_monthly_charges = merged_df[merged_df['Churned_binary'] == 1]['MonthlyCharges']\nretained_monthly_charges = merged_df[merged_df['Churned_binary'] == 0]['MonthlyCharges']\nt_stat, p_value_monthly_charges = ttest_ind(churned_monthly_charges, retained_monthly_charges, nan_policy='omit')\n\nchurned_tenure = merged_df[merged_df['Churned_binary'] == 1]['TenureMonths']\nretained_tenure = merged_df[merged_df['Churned_binary'] == 0]['TenureMonths']\nt_stat_tenure, p_value_tenure = ttest_ind(churned_tenure, retained_tenure, nan_policy='omit')\n\nprint(\"T-test for Monthly Charges:\")\nprint(\"T-statistic:\", t_stat, \"P-value:\", p_value_monthly_charges)\n\nprint(\"\\nT-test for Tenure:\")\nprint(\"T-statistic:\", t_stat_tenure, \"P-value:\", p_value_tenure)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nT-test for Monthly Charges:\nT-statistic: 16.046789508822908 P-value: 6.103197055566191e-57\n\nT-test for Tenure:\nT-statistic: -31.579550511353766 P-value: 7.99905796059022e-205\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# Logistic Regression\n\n## Key Findings\n\n-   **Monthly Charges**:\\\n    Higher monthly charges increase churn likelihood (coef = 0.0296, p \\< 0.000).

This aligns with the identified challenges of high churn among short-tenure, high-paying customers, and dissatisfaction among older subscribers.\n\n## Key Elements of Strategy\n\n1.  **Pricing Optimization**:\n    -   Introduce tiered pricing and loyalty rewards.\n    -   Offer discounts or additional value for high-paying customers.\n2.  **Enhanced Onboarding**:\n    -   Create seamless onboarding programs.\n    -   Incentivize early tenure retention with personalized offers.\n3.  **Targeted Engagement**:\n    -   Develop tailored services for older customers.\n    -   Address customer satisfaction pain points proactively.\n4.  **Data-Driven Monitoring**:\n    -   Analyze churn data to identify patterns.\n    -   Use predictive models to target at-risk customers.\n\n## Expected Benefits\n\n1.  **Reduced Churn Rates**: Pricing adjustments and onboarding improvements will increase customer satisfaction.\n2.  **Increased CLV**: Longer retention reduces acquisition costs and increases revenue.\n3.  **Enhanced Satisfaction**: Tailored strategies for at-risk groups foster loyalty.\n4.  **Proactive Insights**: Data analysis supports continuous improvement.\n\n## Supporting Evidence\n\n1.  **Monthly Charges**: Higher charges increase churn likelihood (coef = 0.0296, p \\< 0.000). Figure 2 also supports this claim.\n2.  **Tenure**: Shorter tenures strongly correlate with churn (t = -31.58, p \\< 0.000). This correlation is strengthened by figure 3.\n3.  **Age**: Older customers show increased churn (coef = 0.0130, p \\< 0.000).\n4.  **Churn Reasons**: Violin plots highlight tenure-based churn patterns, guiding targeted interventions.\n\nThis data-driven strategy offers actionable steps to address churn, enhance retention, and create long-term value.\n\n# Call to Action\n\n## Proposed Actions or Decisions\n\n1.  **Pricing Optimization**:\n    -   Introduce tiered pricing models to cater to diverse customer needs.\n    -   Implement loyalty discounts for long-tenure customers.\n    -   Regularly monitor and adjust pricing to remain competitive.\n2.  **Enhanced Onboarding and Early Retention**:\n    -   Design and roll out an onboarding program that includes personalized welcome messages and tutorials.\n    -   Offer discounts or free trials for the first 6 months to reduce early churn risks.\n3.  **Targeted Engagement Strategies**:\n    -   Develop a dedicated support program for older customers, including simplified plans and personalized assistance.\n    -   Conduct periodic customer satisfaction surveys to identify and address pain points proactively.\n4.  **Data-Driven Monitoring**:\n    -   Implement a churn prediction model to identify at-risk customers.\n    -   Use churn visualizations (e.g., tenure distribution by churn reason) to inform intervention strategies.\n\n## Assignment of Responsibility\n\n1.  **Pricing Optimization**:\n    -   **Marketing and Finance Teams**: Collaborate to define tiered pricing and discount structures.\n    -   **Executive Leadership**: Approve pricing adjustments and allocate budgets.\n2.  **Enhanced Onboarding**:\n    -   **Customer Success Team**: Develop onboarding materials and strategies.\n    -   **IT Department**: Automate welcome processes and integrate retention tools.\n3.  **Targeted Engagement**:\n    -   **Customer Support Team**: Provide tailored support for older customers and conduct satisfaction surveys.\n    -   **Data Analytics Team**: Analyze survey results and identify trends.\n4.  **Data-Driven Monitoring**:\n    -   **Data Science Team**: Build and maintain churn prediction models.\n    -   **Product Managers**: Use insights from churn analysis to prioritize feature development.\n\n## Implementation Timeline\n\n-   **Month 1**:\n    -   Finalize pricing optimization strategies.\n    -   Begin onboarding program development.\n    -   Establish data science resources for churn prediction modeling.\n-   **Month 2**:\n    -   Roll out tiered pricing and loyalty discounts.\n    -   Launch the onboarding program with welcome emails and tutorials.\n    -   Begin customer satisfaction surveys and data analysis.\n-   **Month 3**:\n    -   Launch targeted engagement strategies for older customers.\n    -   Deploy churn prediction models and monitor at-risk customers.\n    -   Review progress and refine strategies based on initial results.\n\nBy taking these actions, the organization will address the root causes of churn, improve customer retention, and maximize long-term revenue potential.\n\n",
