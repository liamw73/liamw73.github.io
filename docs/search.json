    "text": "This proposal utilizes real telecom customer analytics to determine the main drivers for customer churn. Multiple python programs are chained together to generate visualizations along with regression, logical, and statistical significance tests that clarify the telecom market, monthly trends, and correlation between factors that affect the bottom line. This data was used to formulate a final proposal, broken down into monthly phases, that promises to not only reduce customer churn, but also increase customer retention. This project is tailored to C-suite level executives and lays out a path to market domination.\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf"

    "text": "Key Findings\n\nMonthly Charges:\nHigher monthly charges increase churn likelihood (coef = 0.0296, p &lt; 0.000). Customers paying more are more likely to leave, indicating pricing dissatisfaction.\nTenure:\nLonger tenures decrease churn likelihood (coef = -0.0538, p &lt; 0.000). Retention efforts should target customers in their early months.\nAge:\nOlder customers show a slight increase in churn likelihood (coef = 0.0130, p &lt; 0.000), suggesting a need for tailored engagement strategies."
